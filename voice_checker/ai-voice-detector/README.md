# AI Voice Detector

## Overview
The AI Voice Detector is a module designed to detect AI-generated voices and process live audio inputs. It utilizes advanced audio processing techniques and machine learning models to analyze audio streams in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time audio streaming and recording
- Audio preprocessing for normalization and noise reduction
- Feature extraction using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and spectral analysis
- Detection of AI-generated voices using machine learning models
- Ensemble methods for improved detection accuracy

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage
To start the application, use the command line interface:

```
npm run start
```

For a live demo, you can run:
